## Abstract

The second SOFT Frontier Workshop at IROS 2025 will focus on advancing the practical applications of soft robotics. Building on the success of the IROS 2024 workshop [“The SOFT frontiers: adaptive technologies for soft robotics”](https://sites.google.com/view/sft-front/iros-2024), which discussed adaptability in soft robotic systems, this workshop will explore the translation of cutting-edge research into real-world applications. 

Despite significant academic progress, soft robotics has yet to realize its potential in practical applications fully. This workshop aims to provide an in-depth overview of promising applications, such as medicine, environmental fields, and industrial automation, highlighting recent breakthroughs and discussing the critical issues of adaptability, stability, and sustainability in real-world settings. 

The program will feature presentations from leading scientific experts and industrial pioneers, as well as an open call for young researchers to share their innovative work, fostering cross-domain and cross-generational dialogue. Panel discussions will focus on the practical hurdles of deploying soft robots and potential solutions, ensuring the field’s continued growth and impact. 

**Time:** 8:00-12:00, 20 October 2025  
**Location:** Room 102B, Hangzhou International Expo Center (HIEC)

## Call for Young Frontiers

### What?
Instead of a call for papers, we issue a call for young frontiers in this workshop, allowing young researchers to present their systematic research, not just one paper. Organizers will select three winners from the applicants. Each winner can win a prize of <span style="color:red;">**2,000 RMB**</span> sponsored by Soft Robot Technology Co., Ltd. (SRT) and present their work via <span style="color:red;">**a poster and a 10-minute talk**</span>. In addition, they are also invited to join the social dinner sponsored by SRT with senior researchers and industrial experts.

### Who?
PhD students, postdoctoral researchers, and early-career faculty are welcome to apply. The Young Frontiers <span style="color:red;">**MUST**</span> attend in person to give the talk.

### How?
Applicants should send their CV and a one-page talk proposal (no format requirement) to **[sft.frontier@gmail.com](mailto:sft.frontier@gmail.com)**. The proposal should describe how the applicants plan to present their work in a 10-minute talk. Presentations of systematic research related to the practical applications of soft robotics are welcome.

- Application Deadline: <span style="color:red;">**September 1, 2025**</span>  
- Winner Notification: September 15, 2025
